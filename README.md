# Matplotlib Homework - Pharmaceutical-Treatment-Result-Analysis

What good is data without a good plot to tell the story?

The goal of this project was to calculate and display various performance metrics for four pharmaceutical cancer treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, Placebo) on test mice over a 45 day treatment period. Since the baseline data was provided in CSV format, Python with Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib (through Jupyter Notebooks) was used to clean and process the data, as well as calculate and display the desired outputs.

Tasks:

1. Creating a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
2. Creating a scatter plot that shows how the number of [metastatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis) (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
3. Creating a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
4. Creating a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
5. Include 3 observations about the results of the study. Use the visualizations you generated from the study data as the basis for your observations.
